The more cases there are, the darker the color as indicated by the scale on the left-hand side. The county with the most missing person cases is King County, with 193. Pierce county has the second most cases with 110. Furthermore, there are counties with not missing persons cases. </p> </div> <br> <div id="container2"> <div id="vizHolder2"></div> <p>Before exploring the data in more detail, I plotted a line chart to see how the number of cases has changed over the years because this dataset has data from 1951 through 2019. In general, the number of cases has increased over the years. The year that had the greatest number of cases is 2016 with 31. </p> </div> <br> <div id="container3"> <div id="vizHolder3"></div> <p>Further exploring the data through a geographic lens, I created a tree map to break down the number of cases by city. The city with the highest number of cases is Seattle with 101, followed by Tacoma with 59, and Spokane with 32. </p> </div> <br> <div id="container4"> <div id="vizHolder4"></div> <p>The highlight table above displays the average age of missing persons by race when taking into account all sexes. The youngest average age out of all these groups is around 22 years old (Hispanic/Latino), and the oldest average missing age is 36 (White/Caucasian).</p> </div> <br> <div id="container5"> <div id="vizHolder5"></div> <p>The ranked, horizontal bar chart above breaks down the number of cases when singling out minors (anyone younger than 18). A percent of total data transformation was done to see which age group had the most cases. The age that makes up most of the cases for minors is 17 (19.39%). </p> </div> <br> <div id="container6"> <div id="vizHolder6"></div> <p>This pie chart breaks down the missing person cases by race using a percent of total data transformation. As seen in the chart, about 76% of the cases in Washington state are of people who are White/Caucasian (looking at all sexes).</p> </div> <br> <div id="container7"> <div id="vizHolder7"></div> <p>This bar chart examines the cases by race and gender, except this it looks at the raw data. This chart was created to further explore the missing persons data by race. As mentioned before, White/Caucasians comprise the most cases with a total of 512 cases. When also looking at gender, it is noticeable that there are more males missing than females. </p> </div> <br> <div id="container8"> <div id="vizHolder8"></div> <p>Similar to the previous chart, this chart also looks at race and gender. However, this chart only focuses on non-White groups as the previous chart was unable to show the data for POC groups as clearly since White/Caucasians represented the majority of the data. When looking at these groups, African Americans have the most missing person cases followed by Native Americans. When looking at gender, there are more males missing than females overall.</p> </div> <script src="https://ahnguyen27.github.io/react-parcel-an474/index.ec2c72f6.js"></script> <div id="view"></div> </body></html>
